# FAA Cloud Services Playbook

App owners expect to benefit from cloud on their own terms. By assessing tiers of functionality against ROI, the FAA cloud can transform the delivery of IT solutions without alienating stakeholders or breaking the bank.

Today, operations and development do not work well together, resulting in duplication, delays, and cost overruns. To increase the success rate of IT projects, the FAA needs a new approach. We've created a playbook of successful practices from the private sector and government that, if followed together, will help modernize apps and shift Dev and Ops towards DevOps.
