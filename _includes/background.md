## Background
Since 2010, the Federal CIO Council has promoted shared services, data
center consolidation, and Cloud First as key initiatives for all federal
agencies. The FAA is now several years into this transformation, and
with the recent award of the FAA Cloud Services (FCS) contract to a
multi-vendor team led by CSGov, the FAA Cloud Program Team and
supporting AIT personnel are quickly moving to work with Team CSGov and
achieve Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for the Mission Support
Government Community Cloud environment and the Mission Support
Colocation environment in 2016.

Given the phased approach to deploying FCS services and the fact that
the deployment of ANG and NAS cloud domains is anticipated to be years
out, the standards outlined in this document shall be treated in greater
detail for non-NAS platforms that shall achieve IOC in FY16 than for NAS
or ANG platforms that shall be achieve IOC in subsequent years.
