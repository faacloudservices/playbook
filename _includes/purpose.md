##Purpose
In 2016, the FAA approved AIT Business Plan Item 15C.119B1 Target 2,
which identified and documented standard configurations and platforms
required for architecting environments for business owners. This
document provided high level outlines of blueprints that shall be
implemented as stem cell images and automation assets, including the
following:

-   the version of the operating system
-   the patch level of the operating system
-   the networking configuration of operating system
-   the software stack installed on top of the operating system, up
    through the specific versions and configurations of middleware
    components

This document expands upon the content in that document by holistically
outlining three sets of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) standards
tied to a proposed tri-modal model that aligns to increasing levels of
maturity in the adoption of automation and agile development processes.
This approach provides core standards for applications at intermediate
levels of transformation to enable Line of Business (LOB) and IT shared
services leaders to collaboratively make business decisions about
whether an application should be in low, medium, or high gear.
