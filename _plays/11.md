title: Deploy Apps through dev, test, and prod using a master orchestration script
---

Applications combine stem cell images, automation assets, and nested orchestration scripts into a single master orchestration script that acts as the major deployment unit for applications as they move through dev, test, and prod throughout the software development lifecycle. These orchestration scripts shall programmatically define scale units and scaling criteria for deployment environments that provide elasticity.

The master orchestration script acts as the deployment unit across the DevOps toolchain, and in the case of the FCS cloud, this process of deploying applications across this toolchain should be managed by the Agility Release Manager.

### Checklist
1. Develop a standard FAA DevOps Toolchain.
2. Configure this FAA DevOps Toolchain in the Agility Release Manager.
