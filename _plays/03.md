title: Backup automatically via Snapshots
---

At a minimum, applications shall perform disaster recovery by
backing up volumes of all VMs to snapshots. In the FCS environments,
this is can be automated by creating an Agility Platform Event
Policy with a periodic event time that initiates the creation
of snapshots. Recovery would occur by reverting volumes to an
existing snapshot. Note: AWS has backend restrictions that limit an
account to five simultaneous snapshot actions at a single time.
