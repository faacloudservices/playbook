title: Migrate Apps off "Stacked" Infrastructure
---

In the current FAA hosting environments, applications often reside
on middleware components (such as .NET application servers or Oracle
RAC clusters) that are shared with other applications. As a result,
virtual machines contain application logic or databases associated
with multiple applications. Given that applications have different
system owners, security controls, chargeback models, etc., this
model does not work well in cloud environments. As a result, all
applications moving to the cloud must be migrated to virtual
machines that provide middleware services for only one application.
This prevents infrastructure components from crossing system
boundaries and enables migration of existing VM images to the cloud.
While highly discouraged, it may be permissible to migrate common
infrastructure to the cloud if all systems that reside on that
shared infrastructure are cloud suitable without code or
configuration changes. However, this should be considered a
temporary measure and only done alongside a near-term commitment to
refactor the various applications onto logically isolated deployment
units in the cloud.

### Checklist
1. Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
2. Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
3. Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible
4. Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
5. Share findings with the team and agency leadership
6. Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as "user stories"
7. As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people’s needs

### Key Questions
- Who are your primary users?
- What user needs will this service address?
- Why does the user want or need this service?
- Which people will have the most difficulty with the service?
- Which research methods were used?
- What were the key findings?
- How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?
- How often are you testing with real people?
