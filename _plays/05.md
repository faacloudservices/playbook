title: Administer by Command Line and Automate by Scripts
---

To the greatest degree possible, manual systems administration shall
occur using a command line interface such as BASH shell or
PowerShell and all activities shall be logged and retained.

[The TechFAR Handbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/techfar/) provides a detailed explanation of the flexibilities in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that can help agencies implement this play.

### PowerShell Training
Most Windows admins use the GUI, and if they know a command line, it's probably the DOS Prompt and scripting via \*.bat and \*.cmd scripts. Over the past few
years, Microsoft has spent considerable time building out a richer and full-reatures shell environment called PowerShell, and mastering this environment should be a top priority for all FAA personnel that
regularly work with the Microsoft stack.

-   Linux/UNIX Bash Training
    -   Most UNIX and Linux systems administators are culturally experienced
        with working in the Bash shell. However, many personnel can benefit from
        training beyond core shell scripting to the use of more robust scripting
        languages such as Python. Here is a range of materials to cover novice
        to experienced administrators.

1. Budget includes research, discovery, and prototyping activities
2. Contract is structured to request frequent deliverables, not multi-month milestones
3. Contract is structured to hold vendors accountable to deliverables
4. Contract gives the government delivery team enough flexibility to adjust feature prioritization and delivery schedule as the project evolves
5. Contract ensures open source solutions are evaluated when technology choices are made
6. Contract specifies that software and data generated by third parties remains under our control, and can be reused and released to the public as appropriate and in accordance with the law
7. Contract allows us to use tools, services, and hosting from vendors with a variety of pricing models, including fixed fees and variable models like “pay-for-what-you-use” services
8. Contract specifies a warranty period where defects uncovered by the public are addressed by the vendor at no additional cost to the government
9. Contract includes a transition of services period and transition-out plan

### Key Questions
- What is the scope of the project? What are the key deliverables?
- What are the milestones? How frequent are they?
- What are the performance metrics defined in the contract (e.g., response time, system uptime, time period to address priority issues)?
