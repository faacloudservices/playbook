title: Administer by Command Line and Automate by Scripts

To the greatest degree possible, manual systems administration shall
occur using a command line interface such as BASH shell or
PowerShell and all activities shall be logged and retained.

### PowerShell Training
Most Windows admins use the GUI, and if they know a command line, it's probably the DOS Prompt and scripting via \*.bat and \*.cmd scripts. Over the past few
years, Microsoft has spent considerable time building out a richer and full-reatures shell environment called PowerShell, and mastering this environment should be a top priority for all FAA personnel that
regularly work with the Microsoft stack.

###Linux/UNIX Bash Training
Most UNIX and Linux systems administators are culturally experienced with working in the Bash shell. However, many personnel can benefit from training beyond core shell scripting to the use of more
robust scripting languages such as Python. Here is a range of materials to cover novice to experienced administrators.
