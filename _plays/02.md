title: Configure Apps to scale vertically by resizing VMs
---

Despite the fact that elasticity as treated by NIST standards and the FCS contract equates to the horizontal scaling of nodes, it is also technically
possible to vertically scale virtual machines by
shutting down a virtual machines, resizing the virtual machine to a
CCSD 6.6.1 larger size service class code or invoking a vertical
scaling service class code such as Vm\_VPUA\_ADD or adding a higher
network I/O bandwidth supplemental feature, and then booting the
virtual machine back up. While this is disruptive and likely
requires downtime, this approach allows existing applications that
do not have an architecture suitable to horizontal scaling a quick
and easy path to increased capacity. To the greatest degree possible
by the FCS contract and the Agility Platform, low gear applications
should use this capability to resize applications in anticipation of
known spikes in demand or in response to degraded user experience.

### Checklist
1. Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service â€“ both online and in person
2. Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs
3. Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service
4. Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs at each step of the service


### Key Questions
- What are the different ways (both online and offline) that people currently accomplish the task the digital service is designed to help with?
- Where are user pain points in the current way people accomplish the task?
- Where does this specific project fit into the larger way people currently obtain the service being offered?
- What metrics will best indicate how well the service is working for its users?
