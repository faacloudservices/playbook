title: Configure Apps to scale vertically by resizing VMs
---

Despite the fact that elasticity as treated by NIST standards and the FCS contract equates to the horizontal scaling of nodes, it is also technically
possible to vertically scale virtual machines by shutting down a virtual machine instance, resizing the virtual machine instance using a larger
virtual machine size, and restarting the virtual machine. Modern operating systems and properly-configured middleware detect these larger resources
and begin using them without additional manual intervention.

Unlike the FAA's VMWare environment, cloud providers do not support virtualizatin concepts such as "Memory Hot Add" or "CPU Hot Plug," which allow vertical


hot add of memory or virtual CPUs



Because this approach necessitates downtime, it is best performed manually during non-peak
hours.

CCSD 6.6.1 larger size service class code or invoking a vertical
scaling service class code such as Vm\_VPUA\_ADD or adding a higher
network I/O bandwidth supplemental feature, and then booting the
virtual machine back up. While this is disruptive and likely
requires downtime, this approach allows existing applications that
do not have an architecture suitable to horizontal scaling a quick
and easy path to increased capacity. To the greatest degree possible
by the FCS contract and the Agility Platform, low gear applications
should use this capability to resize applications in anticipation of
known spikes in demand or in response to degraded user experience.
