---

Members of the U.S. Digital Services community have spent considerable time developing a general framework for designing cloud-native digital services and they strongly encourage reuse of their
assets. In fact, this site uses one of their templates. [In accordance with OMB wishes,](http://federalnewsradio.com/digital-government/2016/01/omb-wants-see-agencies-using-digital-services-playbook/)
high gear applications shall be designed using the [U.S. Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) and use implemented using the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) as a
starting point.
