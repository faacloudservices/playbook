title: Replicate app to physically seperated backup
---

When disaster recovery requirements exceed those provided by basic backup and recovery of snapshots, the components of a Low Gear application shall be replicated from a hot primary environment to a
cold standby environment with mirrored VMs located in a separate availability zone, region, or data center. The FAA envisions outsourcing the planning and execution of this capability to our cloud integrator
through the higher-level Disaster Recovery CLINs outlined in section 7.6 of the FCS Cloud Computing Services Description.

If possible, the management platform (Agility Platform or vCenter) shall be
configured with automation that performs health checks and powers up and cuts over to the back-up environment when a failure is detected. Alternatively, the management platform shall notify a human operator
for manual failover. This solution can be made highly available by having a warm standby running at all times.

### Key Questions
- Does the application currently use replication software such as EMC Avamar to replicate to a standby environment?

### Checklist
1. Review existing recovery objectives and align to either DR-TF1 or DR-TF2.
2. In conjunction with migration planning, contact the cloud integrator to allow them to begin DR planning.
3. Order DR-TF1 or DR-TF2 along with other FCS CLINs.
4. Complete acceptance testing, including an intial DR test.
5. Work with the cloud integrator to perform an annual DR test.
