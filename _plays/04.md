title: Replicate app to physically seperated backup
---

When disaster recovery requirements exceed those provided by basic
backup and recovery of snapshots, the components of a Low Gear
application shall be replicated from a hot primary environment to a
cold standby environment with mirrored VMs located in a separate
availability zone, region, or data center. If possible, the
management platform (Agility Platform or vCenter) shall be
configured with automation that performs health checks and powers up
and cuts over to the back-up environment when a failure is detected.
Alternatively, the management platform shall notify a human operator
for manual failover. This solution can be made highly available by
having a warm standby running at all times.
