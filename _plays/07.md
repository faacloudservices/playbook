title: Automate deployment of Operating Systems using Stem Cell Images
---

The use of golden images shall be avoided and virtual machines shall
be implemented using base [Stem Cell
Images](http://madstop.com/post/85950592485/golden-image-or-foil-ball-repost),
which eschew specialization, middleware, or server roles and only
provide the absolute minimal subset of operating system components
and management agents (either FAA or external partners such
as CSGov) to provide a pre-hardened base operating system targeting
a particular deployment environment (on-premise FAA versus cloud).
In the case of FCS, these stem cell images are orderable in the
Agility Designer tool as Agility Workloads. In order to ensure
commonality between FCS and on premise FAA environments, the FAA
should formally define and maintain standard server images that
apply across all environments and work with CSGov to have the images
behind the FCS Operating System supplemental features implement
these base standards.
