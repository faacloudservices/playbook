title: Develop Stem Cell Images, Automation Assets, and Orchestration Scripts using agile techniques and software configuration management (SCM) tools.
---

In an [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/infrastructure-code-reason-smile)
world, traditional operations teams need to form agile
infrastrucutre teams capable of building and managing a service
catalog of automation assets using the same agile techniques and
professional software configuration management tools used by
application developers. In a DevOps setting, these agile
infrastructure teams work closely with agile application / digital
services teams to smooth out the traditional division between
development and operations. The assets produced by these agile
infrastructure teams populate a service catalog and are consumed by
application teams on an as needed basis. The application teams are
consumers of these infrastructure automation assets and stakeholders
that make feature and function requests and potentially fork
automation code and initiate pull requests. The agile infrastructure
team works with configuration management and security to get the
asset pre-approved and pre-authorized in order to minimize the
authorization footprint for individual FAA applications.
