title: Develop Images, Automation, and Orchestration using agile techniques and SCM tools.
---

In an [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/infrastructure-code-reason-smile) world, traditional operations teams need to form agile
infrastrucutre teams capable of building and managing a service catalog of automation assets using the same agile techniques and professional software configuration management (SCM) tools used by
application developers. In a DevOps setting, these agile infrastructure teams work closely with agile application / digital services teams to smooth out the traditional division between
development and operations. The assets produced by these agile infrastructure teams populate a service catalog and are consumed by application teams on an as needed basis. The application teams are
consumers of these infrastructure automation assets and stakeholders that make feature and function requests and potentially fork automation code and initiate pull requests. The agile infrastructure
team works with configuration management and security to get the asset pre-approved and pre-authorized in order to minimize the authorization footprint for individual FAA applications.

### Key Questions
- Where should an agile infrastrucutre team reside within the FAA's IT Shared Services organization?

### Checklist
1. AIT must form agile infrastrucutre teams focused on delivering automation assets
2. Leverage existing SCM tools used for applications for the creation of automation assets
3. Create and execute a development lifecycle for automation assets
