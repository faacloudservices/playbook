title: Design for cloud by default... even if you can't get deploy there yet.
---

Cloud-native apps use highly distributed architectures that decomposed functionality into load-balanced pools of loosely-coupled stateless nodes that
communicate over well defined standard interfaces, such as message queues. This architecture enables horizontal scaling and designs for failure using
automated health checks that look for node failure and automatically restore service.

Even in situations where latency or coupling with legacy systems of record might seem to make a particular app unsuitable for cloud in the near term,
development should target these architectural principals anyways. Federal cloud is rapidly evolving to include [support for FISMA high](https://www.fedramp.gov/provide-public-comment/fedramp-high-baseline/)
and [DHS-compliant TIC cloud services](https://www.fedramp.gov/draft-fedramp-tic-overlay/), so there is a high likelihood that if not initially cloud suitable, new applications shall become suitable for cloud
services during their lifespan. Until that becomes reality, the FAA operations team should partner with our vendors to judiously bring cloudy innovations back into
FAA data centers. In a world where Node.js and MongoDB apps run on Ubuntu on [mainframe](http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/16/ibm-teams-with-canonical-on-linux-mainframe/) and
VMWare offers drop-in modules for [OpenStack](https://www.vmware.com/products/openstack) and [Docker containers](http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2015/10/vsphere-integrated-containers-technology-walkthrough.html),
there is little excuse not to design with cloud in mind.

### Key Questions
- Does your application rely on legacy systems of record such as IBM mainframe, high-end UNIX systems, or non-virtualized NAS systems?
- If an aspect of the application acts as an inhibitor to moving to the cloud, can pieces of your application move to the cloud?
- If unable to move to the cloud, is your current hosting provide able to establish production-ready equivilent services by your need-by date?

### Checklist
1. Complete a detailed cloud suitability assessment
2. Identify major cloud inhibitors
3. Work with the FCS program office to compensate for those inhibitors
4. Work with your current hosting provider to provide API-driven provisioning, container hosting, and other core cloud features
