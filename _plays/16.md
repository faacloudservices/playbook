title: Modularize the APIs of proprietary services into external connectors invoked by an abstraction layer
---

When proprietary cloud services are required, abstract the APIs of
those services into a modularized connector and attempt to invoke
this connector via an interface that enables development of
additional connectors in order to be able to use similar services
offered by other CSPs. To the greatest degree possible, design an
abstraction that is designed to be extensible to alternative CSP
services via additional connector modules.
