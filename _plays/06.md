title: Separate app tiers into separate VM pools and subnets
---

Excepting the most trivial of applications, application tiers shall
be refactored into separate pools of one or more virtual machines
running in seperate subnets. This achieves greater functional
decoupling of the applications tiers and enables greater flexibility
in implementing security controls between those tiers using Network ACLs or
other security models provided by the deployment environment.

### Key Questions
- What are the deployment units for the various application tiers?
- What are the protocols and ports used to communicate between tiers?

### Checklist
1. Seperate out tiers into seperate VMs located in seperate subnets.
2. Tighten down the security controls for each subnet, allowing through only the identified and documented protocols and ports.
