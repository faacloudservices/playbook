title: Separate app tiers into separate VM pools and subnets
---

Excepting the most trivial of applications, application tiers shall
be refactored into separate pools of one or more virtual machines
running in seperate subnets. This achieves greater functional
decoupling of the applications tiers and enables greater flexibility
in implementing security controls between those tiers usand tighten
down the security controls between these tiers using Network ACLs or
other security models provided by the deployment environment.
