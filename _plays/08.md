title: Automate deployment of Platforms and Middleware stacks using an Automated Configuration Management tool
---

In concert with the base Stem Cell images discussed above, automate the installation and configuration of middleware
using automation assets developed on a common automated configuration management platform that spans all FAA data centers
and cloud environments. These automation assets shall deploy the standard configurations of software stacks, such as those outlined
in AIT Business Plan Item 15C.119B1, Standard Configurations and Platforms. Examples of automated configuration management tools
include [Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/), and [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/)

### Key Questions
- Does the application currently have automation under version control involved in deployment or administration?

### Checklist
1. Prior to play, AIT must create a standard for automated configuration management and work with our cloud integrator to use this solution.
2. Use the gap analysis results of comparing current golden image and new FAA-wide "stem cell" image standard to write a specification for the desired state needed to achieve functional parity with your pre-existing golden image.
3. Identify additional manual deployment steps and add to specification.
4. Implement automation to achieve this desired state using the standard automated configuration management tool.
5. Test to ensure automation works properly
6. Maintain automation under version control and manage as a software asset.
